## Advanced Features
- Registration Number Generator

## Project Outcomes
- User will be able to login & Signup. And if the user forget their password, then they can change their password using the "Forgot Password" button.
- User will be able to access the Homepage.
- User will be able to maintain the records of Students, Faculty, Hostel and Library based on their access level.
- Records of every student, faculty, hostel records and book issued in library are available with their scanned copy. 
- The E books can be downloaded in .zip format
- Only Registered Users can view the data and download books while only the admin and faculty members can edit the details, thus providing protection to the data.

## Scope
- Can be applied in Coaching Institutes, Industries, Colleges, Schools etc.
- Useful for the students, faculty and the administration

## Installation
- Import this project into your IDE.
- Create a new Database and set name as 'college_man_sys'. After that, import 'college_man_sys.sql' file (Attached with this folder) in this database.

## Database Connection
We have used the following data for database connection

- url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/Collegedata";
- user name="root";
- password="qsaw1234?";

If you want to change this data, then open "college-management-system-java\src\repository\DBConnection.java"

## How to Run
